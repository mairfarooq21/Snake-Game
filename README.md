# Snake-Game
A classic snake game implemented in html, css and JavaScript. The game handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the game elements using Canvas. The game also detects collisions with the wall or the snake's own body and ends the game when necessary. Overall, the project provides a basic implementation of the Snake game, allowing users to run it by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
